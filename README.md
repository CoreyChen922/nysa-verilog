nysa-verilog
============

Verilog Repository for Nysa. This was originally designed to work intimately with Nysa but over the years this has been where I put a lot of my Verilog cores. If you're interested in viewing all the cores you can go directly to the [Wishbone Cores](http://github.com/CospanDesign/nysa-verilog/tree/master/verilog/wishbone/slave).

View the [Wiki](http://github.com/CospanDesign/nysa-verilog/wiki) for more information.
